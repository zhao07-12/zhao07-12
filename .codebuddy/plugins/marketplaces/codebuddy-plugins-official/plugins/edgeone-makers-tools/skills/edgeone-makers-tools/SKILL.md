  EdgeOne Makers platform development router — the single entry point for building,
  storing data, and deploying on Tencent EdgeOne Makers. Trigger whenever the user
  develops, scaffolds, or deploys anything on EdgeOne Makers / EdgeOne Pages: AI agents
  (DeepAgents, LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenAI/Claude SDK), Cloud Functions (Node/Go/Python),
  Edge Functions (V8), KV + Blob storage, middleware, CLI usage, project scaffolding,
  and — importantly — persisting dynamic site data (messages, uploads, votes, save-state)
  where there is NO managed database, so Blob is used as the backend. Also trigger on
  "deploy to EdgeOne", "上线", "发布", "部署到 EdgeOne". This SKILL is a routing table;
  read only the sub-skill relevant to the current task, never all of them at once.
